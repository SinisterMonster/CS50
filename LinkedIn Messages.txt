Hello xxxxxxx,

Thank you for connecting. 

I noticed that Boston Scientific is seeking skilled individuals to fill multiple roles in your Quality Assurance/ Quality Engineering departments.

Would you be kind enough to point me toward the person tasked with hiring for these roles?

I am an experienced Quality Systems Specialist, recognized by the American Society for Quality (ASQ). I have experience spearheading the implementation of quality systems, and cGMP practices. I have also led the development of a QMS from scratch at my current employer and achieved MDSAP certification.

Thank you very much and I hope you have a great day!

Regards,
Arun


 
Would it be possible for us to have a conversation about your needs and how I might be a match?

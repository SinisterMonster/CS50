Stats from the database:
Avg valence = 0.484443
Avg energy = 0.65906
Avg danceability = 0.71646

I think this is how Spotify might characterrize a persons 'aura':
Purple -High danceability and valence?
Green - High valence and low energy (maybe high tempo?)
Pink - Low valence and low danceability
Orange -Avg energy is highest of 3 stats
Yellow - Avg valence is highest of 3 stats
Blue - Avg valence and danceability low (maybe <50%?)

Why is this not verry representative of a person?
Because music taste change over time and based on what a person might feel throughout the day.
More over if they are just considering straight average without a measure of spread, then the resulting
data will be skewed
